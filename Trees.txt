1.Heap is complete binary tree.
2.Hashing to deal with collision rather than using linked list use binary search trees.
3.Left child in heap is 2i+1
4.Right child is 2i+2
5.Parent is floor(i-1)
6.element with indices greater than floor(n/2)-1 where n is the number of elements in the heap are leaf nodes
7.Height of heap is of the order O(logn)
8.Single Max-heapify can take O(height of node) time.Number of nodes at a particular height is ceiling(n/pow(2,h)).So Time complexity is Summation h goes from 0 to logn celing(n/pow(2,h))*O(h)
