Regularization:-
Underfitting:-High Bias.
Overfitting:-High Variance.
To prevent overfitting:-
	1.Reduce number of features.
		a.Model Selection Algorithms--------------------
		b.Manual Removal
	2.Regularization
		Reducing the value of less useful params.
Cost Function in Regularization:-
	Smaller Value of params means simpler hypothesis,less prone to overfitting
	Use regularization parameter lamba carefully.
	multiselection help to choose lambda automatically.-----------

Regularized Cost Function for LRegression:-
d(J(theta))/d(theta) just add lamba*theta/m

Support Vector Machines
1.Line of Least Commitment.
2.w(transpose)*x+b=1,-1,0(hyperplanes)
3.distance between 2 lines(b1-b1)/w
4.perpendicular to a plane is w vector.
5.We want to maximize 2/(length(w))
