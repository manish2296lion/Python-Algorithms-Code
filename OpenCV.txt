1.Blurring is smoothing
2.If nearby pixels are similar and noise is independent then a centered weighted moving average is the right thing to do.
3.Isotropic means circularly symmetric.
4.Separability in some kernels or filters (linearly separable filters like gaussian) can greatly increase Computation Complexity.
5.Few ways to deal with filtering reducing image size.
			a.clip filter
			b.wrap around
			c.copy edge
			d.reflect across egde.(best)
6.median filtering is edge preserving(useful to remove salt and pepper noise).
7.gradient points in the direction of most rapid change in intensity.and mag of that vector is how much it is changing.
